<title>OGNL Overview</title>
<body>
    <p>OGNL stands for Object-Graph Navigation Language; it is an expression language
    for getting and setting properties of Java objects. You use the same expression
    for both getting and setting the value of a property.</p>

    <p>OGNL started out as a way to set up associations between UI
    components and controllers using property names.  As the desire for
    more complicated associations grew, Drew Davidson created what he
    called KVCL, for Key-Value Coding Language, egged on by Luke
    Blanshard.  Luke then reimplemented the language using ANTLR, came up
    with the new name, and, egged on by Drew, filled it out to its current
    state.</p>

    <p>We pronounce OGNL as a word, like the last syllables of a drunken
    pronunciation of "orthogonal" or like "ogg-null".</p>
